=== OpenStack Templates

Template creation was explained and the customer was able to create
their own templates from VMs. Yale NUS will provide OpenStack templates
for provisioning purposes.

=== Create VM

For demonstration purposes, two VMs were created, one from the RHEL 6
DVD ISO and one from the RHEL 7 ISO.  The customer also was able to
create virtual machines including demonstrating their ability to
provision.
