== YaleNUS Cloudforms Architecture

At YaleNUS we had some discussions around the size of the environment.  Some of the questions that were asked were: 

* How many VMs will be managed in your virtualization environment?
* Do you have provisioning templates in place?
* Do you have multiple data centers that need to be managed?
* Do you have a local NTP server?
* Do you have a local DNS or remote DNS service?
* Are forward and reverse DNS resolution configured in your environment?
* Is there at least 42 GB disk space on target virtualization platform?

At Yale NUS the objective of the engagement was to integrate the new Red Hat OpenStack environment and Microsoft AD 
environment where they housed their users. Yale NUS would like to implement a Self-service provisioning system using 
Cloudforms as the front end where professors and students would only see the VM's that they owned.

Yale uses Microsoft Active Directory (AD) as their directory service implementation. An AD domain controller 
authenticates and authorizes Yale NUS users assigning and enforcing security policies. The VMs are used by student, 
faculty and other users as well as by the operations group. 

This information gave us a general idea of the size of the environment and allowed us to figure out how to size 
the Cloudforms database adequately the first time around. The new appliance does not include the database disk 
so with the database appliance we are required to create a separate database disk that would be used by the 
Database Appliance.

In addition, we briefly discussed the overall Cloudforms architecture which included discussions on Zones and 
the roles of each appliance.  

There are three main roles for an appliance:
* UI Appliance – allows the user to interact with the Cloudforms user interface
* Worker Appliance – The workhorse which collects all the information from the virtualization environment and sends it to the database to be persisted.
* Database Appliance – one of the most important appliances since it holds all of the data collected by the workers from the virtualization environment.

It is considered a best practice to separate the appliance responsibilities into these three roles.  Each appliance can be configured with the appropriate roles and tuned to be more performant in the overall environment. 

The Basic Architecture for Cloudforms can be described in a simple Triangle:

image::./images/CF-Triangle.png[]

The diagram not only depicts the three main roles for the appliances but also the zones that should be created 
to house each type of appliance.  It is best practice to create three zones in a Cloudforms environment: 

* UI Zone
* Database Zone 
* Worker Zone. 

If we were to draw a box around the triangle this would define a Region.  

A region should have a Database Zone with only one Database Appliance to house all the virtual environment 
information. If there are multiple data centers, in different geographic locations, you would replicate the
architecture at each data center. The database appliances can be configured to include the Synchronization 
server role to replicate its contents to a main database. Best practice states that you should only 
have one database appliance handling the data for one data center.  

The current implementation for YaleNUS only has one appliance but this can easily be extended in future phases 
of the project.

=== Initial Cloudforms Engine Setup

To manage a ~1500 virtual machines workload in a virtualization environment, multiple appliances should be created
and the roles distributed for better performance and redundancy: 1 DB, 2 Web UI and 4 Workers. Red Hat recommends 
5 Workers in the scenario of ~1500 virtual machines, to maintain a 300:1 VM to appliance ratio. 

To increase performance, increase the default 4 vCPUs/6GB RAM appliance configuration to 4 vCPUs/8GB RAM for the 
Web UI appliance and 4 vCPUs/8GB RAM for the DB and the Worker appliances.

With a new CFME appliance the Database is not shipped configured by default. There will need to be a separate 
Database disk created outside of the appliance and then connected once the appliance has been started. In this case,
after looking at where the current VM count and number of VM's that will be coming over the next few years the 
Database can be sized to 150GB. This will allow for growth over the next few years.
 
Once started, the appliances need to be configured with basic network settings using the a console in 
the OpenStack client. Login as admin/smartvm and press Enter to go to the Advanced Settings menu.  Set Static 
Network Configuration, Set Hostname, Set Timezone, Date, and Time. When done entering the settings, select Summary Information to review.

=== CFME Appliance Configuration

To configure the appliance(s), log on to the web server on each appliance at 
https://appliance-fqn-name, using the default credentials admin/smartvm in 
the login screen. Use the Web UI to configure the system(s). 

NTP server for network time synchronization and SMTP server information 
(to enable CFME to send event triggered messages) were configured.

=== CFME Appliance Authentication
The default root password (smartvm) should be changed on all appliances as 
well as the Web UI Admin password. Here are the steps to change the password:

* Configure > Configuration. 
* Select Access Control > Users > Administrator > User Information. 
* Password/Confirm Password. 
* Click Save.

YaleNUS wants to use LDAP authentication to leverage Yale's Microsoft Active Directory infrastructure. 

* Select Configure > Configuration <select zone, server> > Authentication > Mode > LDAPS.

* In Configure > Configuration  <select zone, server> > Authentication > LDAP Settings
** Enter values for LDAP Host Names, LDAP Port, User Type and User Suffix.

== Zones
If YaleNUS decides to add more than one appliance Red hat suggests that the 
appliaces are organized the into zones to configure failover and isolate 
traffic. A Management System that is discovered by a Server in a specific 
zone gets monitored and managed in that zone. All jobs, such as a 
SmartState Analysis or VM power operation, dispatched by a Server in a 
specific zone can get processed by any CFME appliance assigned to that same 
zone.

=== YaleNUS CFME UI Appliance 

The UI appliance is the one that allows the user to interact with the 
Cloudforms user interface. Access to the UI appliance is achieved by using 
your favorite web browser such as Firefox or Google Chrome. The UI Appliance 
has a limited set of roles that it needs to support and they are:

* Notifier
* Provider operations
* Reporting
* Scheduler
* User Interface
* Web Services

YaleNUS has only one appliance in their architecture so ensure that all these
roles are selected.

==== YaleNUS CFME Appliance Tuning Tip
As mentioned, the Worker Appliances will be doing most of the work collecting 
data from the virtualization environments and persisting the data by sending 
the information to the Database. The CFME Appliance will be the main appliance 
that the user will interact with. We want to make sure that it performs 
adequately for the user. A quick tuning for the YaleNUS CFME Appliance is to 
change the Count setting on the UI Worker to 2. The Count setting equates to 
how many threads the UI appliance will have to service the user interface.

To change the setting attach to the UI Appliance, Navigate to 
Configure->Configuration first and select the Workers tab. Change the UI 
Worker entry count to 2. If you have other UI Appliances in your environment 
do ahead and change each of the appliances settings.


=== YaleNUS Worker Appliance

The Worker Appliance is the work horse which collects all the information 
from the virtualization environment and sends it to the database to be 
persisted.The server roles that should be configured in the Worker 
Appliances are:
* Automation Engine
* C&U Coordinator
* C&U Data Collector
* C&U Data Processor
* Event Monitor
* Notifier
* Provider Inventory
* Provider Operations
* Scheduler
* SmartProxy
* SmartState Analysis
* User Interface
* Web Services

Notice that in the YaleNUS environment we currently have one appliance. All the
above roles should be checked in that CFME appliance.

=== YaleNUS CFME Database Appliance
The database appliance is one of the most important appliances since it holds 
all of the data collected by the workers from the virtualization environment. 
The server roles that should be configured in the DB appliances are:

* User Interface
* Web Services
* Database Operations

.Optional Database Appliance Tuning Tip
TIP: The Database Appliance will also be working very hard depending on how 
     much data the Worker Appliances are collecting. One of the things that 
     needs to be adjusted are the setting for the shared_buffers in the 
     postgresql.conf file. Since we will have a dedicated database appliance 
     in our environment we will use the DEDICATED CONFIGURATION setting for 
     the shared_buffers variable. This will allow the database to be more 
     performant. 

Here are the steps to change the settings from our tip above:

* First ssh to the appliance: ssh root@database-appliance
* Adjust postfix settings
  [root@vm-dbappliance-01 data]# cd /opt/rh/postgresql92/root/var/lib/pgsql/data
* Make a copy of the configuration file.
  [root@vm-dbappliance-01 data]# cp -p postgresql.conf{,.20150601}
* Edit the postgresql.conf file:
  [root@vm-dbappliance-01 data]# vi postgresql.conf
* Comment #shared_buffers = 128MB  # MIQ Value SHARED CONFIGURATION
* Uncomment shared_buffers = 1GB  # MIQ Value DEDICATED CONFIGURATION

  [root@vm-dbappliance-01 data]# diff postgresql.conf{.20131021,}

  112,113c112,113

  < shared_buffers = 128MB  # MIQ Value SHARED CONFIGURATION

  < #shared_buffers = 1GB # MIQ Value DEDICATED CONFIGURATION

  ---

  > #shared_buffers = 128MB  # MIQ Value SHARED CONFIGURATION

  > shared_buffers = 1GB # MIQ Value DEDICATED CONFIGURATION

Note: Services are restarted on the appliance after saving the changes in the database settings.


== YaleNUS Self-Service Requirements
At Yale the objective of the engagement was to integrate the Red Hat OpenStack
virtualization environment and Microsoft AD environment where they house their 
user base. YaleNUS would like to implement a Self-service provisioning system 
using Cloudforms as the front end where users would only see the VM's that 
they owned.

Yale uses Microsoft Active Directory (AD) as their directory service 
implemention.  An AD domain controller authenticates and authorizes Yale's 
users assigning and enforcing security policies.
 
There are two ways to use LDAP groups with CFME:
* Create groups with a specific set of names as provided by Cloudforms.  
These groups automatically get assigned to a specific role.

* Assign pre-existing groups from your LDAP server to Cloudforms account role.

NOTE: If the LDAP user is not a member of any defined groups, then the user 
will be denied access to CFME.

Cloudforms uses role-based access to grant users only the rights they need.   
Some built-in roles are provided as part of the product.  User groups are then 
assigned to roles and users are assigned to the groups.  Finally, you can 
customize the roles to a fine level of detail, or create your own.

TODO: Document requirements

=== YaleNUS Taxonomy
During our time at Yale we started discussing briefly the taxonomy of their 
User and Group environment.  The purpose of a taxonomy is to attempt to create 
an orderly classification of users and groups according to their relationships 
in the IT environment and associate these relationships in the CFME Appliance.
The taxonomy will be derived from analysis of usage patterns and information 
flow in the YaleNUS environment.  

The discussions were very brief due to the data center move activities. 
Nonetheless the goal of these discussions around User and Group environment is 
to provide YaleNUS with the following features: 

* A view of how their users will be organized in the Microsoft AD environment.
* Enable self-service and accelerate the delivery of IT services by giving 
  Students/Faculty direct access to customizable service catalogs and virtual 
  assets through role-based access.
* Provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) to reduce provisioning and 
  approval times.
* VMs, complex services, and multi-tier applications can all be requested and 
  deployed automatically based on enforceable policies.
* When we build the taxonomy we need to think about the following:
** The taxonomy will be hierarchical. The classification of users will be 
   multilevel, representing hierarchical relationships between their roles 
   within a defined scope and context.
** The taxonomy will be used to categorize roles that will define access to 
   different Virtual Machine templates and instances. 
** An authorized user should be given a hierarchical listing of categories 
   from which he or she can assign labels to content items (tagging). 
   The assigned category should then be reviewed as part of the assessment and 
   approval process.

=== Defined User Groups
For YaleNUS we have defined the following groups:
* YaleNUS-Admin - Basic YaleNUS Administrator group. 
  This group will have superuser capabilities.
* YaleNUS-<Project> - User group to be associated with their current 
  project.
* YaleNUS-<Project>-Admin - This is the Project Administrator 
  i.e. Group for Professors.

NOTE: Red Hat Consulting and YaleNUS need to have discussions around the 
      requirements around User Groups and Roles.

=== Defined Roles
As part of the Yale's business requirements document the following AD groups 
will need to be defined at YaleNUS: 

* YaleNUS System Administrator group = (YaleNUS-Admin)
* YaleNUS Projects = (YaleNUS-History, YaleNUS-Geology, ??)
* YaleNUS Project Admins = (YaleNUS-History-Admin, YaleNUS-Geology-Admin, ??)

NOTE: Red Hat Consulting and YaleNUS need to have discussions around the 
      requirements around User Groups and Roles.
